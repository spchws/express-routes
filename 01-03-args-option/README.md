# Node.js CLI basic, accept command option

## Exercise:

1.  Add command line option to "write" the text

- Ex. `node index.js w "Once upon a time"`
- Hint: the 1st argument should be treated as option.
- Hint: the 2nd argument is the input text.

2.  When writing a new text, it must continue on the next line.

3.  Test and see if it works as expected.

## Challenge:

1.  If the option is not `w`, display error "invalid option"
